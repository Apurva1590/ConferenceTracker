You can use the [OAuth.io](https://oauth.io/) service to simplify your coding for working with social media accounts and connect with two for free. In this
application we are using it for the Twitter and LinkedIn OAuth support. 

1. [Sign up](https://oauth.io/ for a free account

1. Install the [OAuth PhoneGap plugin](https://github.com/oauth-io/oauth-phonegap). 


>This essentially adds the InAppBrowser plugin.
